Our program takes one file from a sick patient's cell line.
Then let's say we have a bunch of 101bps, we take the first 20bp then compare it with the whole data set,
then we take the second 20bp and compare it with the whole data set and so forth. 
Then it checks how many of these 20bp have repeated. 
We used 20bp because we wanted to reduce the run time (ultimately we were unable to run the code because it 
was predicted to take more than 2 hours of run time on our weak laptops). 
If the 20bp repeats more than 50 times, we store it because we deem it as significant. 
Then we take this list of stored 20bp and compare it to Her2 sequences. 
And if it appears in Her2, we keep them, if not we discard it. 
Then we take these repeats and compare it to other healthy and sick patients. 
In the end, the program will acquire six numbers (from three healthy cell lines and three sick cell lines). 
It will then divide them into two groups: healthy and diseased. 
Then it will get the mean and standard deviation for both of the groups, and create a bar plot.
